# jet-wp-vars

Enables Setting Variables for use in WP Content

## Purpose

I often find myself wanting to access a variable value in several places in WordPress (for example, an hourly rate for a service that is mentioned in several places). This gives me a quick place to manage those values and then use the variable names in my content markup.

## How to use it:

Just drop the folder into your wp-content plugins folder and activate it.
